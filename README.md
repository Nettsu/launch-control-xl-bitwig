Novation Launch Control XL Bitwig Script
=====================================

- The eight columns on the controller correspond to the first eight tracks in
  the project. If the track is a group, then both the group and all it's
  children are controlled by this one column.
- The first knobs control the first three remote controls of the first device on each track.
- The first row of buttons control the fourth remote control. Press the button to
  set the control to 100%, press again to set to 0%. Good for controlling button
  modulators.
- The UP and DOWN side buttons control tempo.
- The LEFT and RIGHT side buttons control the crossfader.
- The DEVICE, SOLO, MUTE and ARM side buttons change the function of the second row of buttons.
- While in DEVICE mode, the second row of buttons works like the first, but
  for the fifth remote control.

The script needs the Launch Control XL to be in 'User 1' mode.
