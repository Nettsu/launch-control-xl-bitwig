Novation Launch Control XL Bitwig Script
=====================================

- The eight columns on the controller correspond to the first eight tracks in
  the project. If the track is a group, then both the group and all it's
  children are controlled by this one column.
- The first two knobs control the first two remote controls of the first device on each track.
- The third knob controls the first send of the track.
- The first row of buttons indicate the state of the clip launcher for the track:
    + bright green means a clip is queued
    + dark green means it is playing
    + yellow means it is queued for stop
    + no colour means all clips are stopped
- Press the button to stop clips on the corresponding track.
- The UP and DOWN buttons control tempo.
- The LEFT and RIGHT buttons control the crossfader.
- The SOLO, MUTE and ARM buttons change the function of the second row of buttons.

The script needs the Launch Control XL to be in 'User 1' mode.
